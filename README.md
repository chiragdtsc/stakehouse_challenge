# index-stakehouse-validators-challenge



# Understanding the Challenge:

- It involves indexing data related to stakehouse validators in Ethereum.
- The goal is to index the balance of a stakehouse validator using their BLS public key and the savETH registry contract.
- The balance needs to be indexed at regular intervals (every epoch, which is 6.4 minutes).
- The associated index ID for a BLS public key needs to be obtained using the associatedIndexIdForKnot function from the contract.

# Analyzing the Requirements:

- I am starting with a single BLS public key and index its balance every epoch.
- Then fetching the associated index ID using the associatedIndexIdForKnot function.
- Using the knotDETHBalanceInIndex function to fetch the balance associated with the index ID and BLS public key.
- Storing the indexed balances in a data structure.
- Considering scalability for handling multiple BLS public keys, I'm going to apply parallel processing approach.

# Identifying Components:

- Smart Contract: savETH registry contract with ABI and relevant functions.
- Ethereum Consensus Layer Node: Connect to an Ethereum node (Goerli) to interact with the contract.
- Web3 Provider: Set the URL for the Ethereum node provider.
- Code Logic: JavaScript and Web3 library to interact with the contract, fetch balances, and index them.
- Data Structure: Determine an appropriate data structure to store the indexed balances.

# Designing the Solution:

- Importing necessary modules, configurations, and set up the Web3 provider.
- Creating functions to interact with the contract and fetch balances using the BLS public key and associated index ID.
- Implementing the logic to index balances at regular intervals and store them.
- Extending the solution to handle multiple BLS public keys by iterating over the sample keys and processing each one.

# Scaling Considerations:

To scale the solution to handle many BLS public keys efficiently, we can think about the following techniques:

- Parallel Processing: Utilizing asynchronous processing and concurrency to fetch balances for multiple BLS public keys simultaneously.
- Asynchronous Processing: JavaScript and web3.js support asynchronous programming using Promises, async/await, or callback functions. Taking     
advantage of these asynchronous features to execute multiple tasks concurrently, making efficient use of the available resources and minimizing waiting time.
- Batch Processing: Group multiple requests and fetch balances in batches to minimize network overhead.
- Optimization: Continuously optimize the code, data structures, and algorithms to improve efficiency and reduce resource consumption.

Command to run code: <br>
  ```npm start```
  
The code in ```main.js``` is responsible for indexing the balance of stakehouse validators in Ethereum using the savETH registry contract. The documentation below provides an overview of the code structure and functionality.
 
# Prerequisites
Node.js and npm should be installed.
Required dependencies should be installed via npm install.
 
# Importing Required Modules and Configurations

SAVETH_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: The Ethereum contract address of  the savETH registry.<br>
SAVETH_REGISTRY_ABI: The ABI of the savETH registry contract.<br>
WEB3_PROVIDER_URL: The URL of the Web3 provider, which connects to the Ethereum network.<br>
SAMPLE_VALIDATOR_BLS_PUBLIC_KEY: A sample BLS public key of a validator.<br>
 
# Instantiating Web3 and the Contract
 
The code uses the Web3 library to connect to the Ethereum network using the provided WEB3_PROVIDER_URL.<br>
A contract object is instantiated using the Web3.eth.Contract method, passing the SAVETH_REGISTRY_ABI and SAVETH_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS as arguments.
 


# Class: IndexingStakehouseValidator
<br>

This class encapsulates the functionality for indexing stakehouse validatorâ€™s balances.

Properties:
 
indexValidatorBalanceStore: An array to store the indexed validator balances.
 
Method: getAssociatedIndexId(blsPublicKey)
<br><br>
Retrieves the associated index ID (hashed key) for a given BLS public key using the associatedIndexIdForKnot function from the contract.
Returns the associated index ID.
 
Method: fetchBalance(blsPublicKey, associatedIndexId)
<br><br>
Fetches the balance of a stakehouse validator associated with the given BLS public key and associated index ID.
Uses the knotDETHBalanceInIndex function from the contract.
Returns the balance.
 
Method: getValidatorBalanceOnEpochs(blsPublicKey)
<br><br>
Retrieves the balance of a stakehouse validator on each epoch.
Retrieves the associated index ID for the given BLS public key.
Sets an epoch interval to fetch the balance at each epoch.
Stores the epoch-wise balance in the balanceEpochWiseStore array.
Returns the balanceEpochWiseStore array.
 
Method: processMultipleValidatorKeys(validatorsBLSPublicKeys)
<br><br>
Processes balances for multiple stakehouse validator keys.
Iterates over each BLS public key in the validatorsBLSPublicKeys array.
Calls getValidatorBalanceOnEpochs to retrieve the balance on each epoch for each validator.
Stores the balances in the indexValidatorBalanceStore array.
 
Method: run(validatorsBLSPublicKeys)
<br><br>
Runs the indexing process for multiple stakehouse validators.
Calls the processMultipleValidatorKeys method with the validatorsBLSPublicKeys array.
Prints the indexValidatorBalanceStore array.
